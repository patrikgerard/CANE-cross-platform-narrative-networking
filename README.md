**Bridging the Narrative Divide: Cross-Platform Discourse Networks in Fragmented Ecosystems**

We present a scalable, platform-agnostic framework for constructing user-user graphs based on shared narrative participation, enabling analysis of discourse dynamics across fragmented platforms. Using data from X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social during the 2024 U.S. Presidential election, we show that a small, structurally embedded set of users, "bridge users" we associated with the majority of narrative migration between platforms.
